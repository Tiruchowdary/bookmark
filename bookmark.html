    <h2 id="chapter1" style="color: green;">chapter 1</h2>
    <p style="background-color: orange; font-weight: bold;">he protagonist of the novel is Amir; the book is told from his point of view. His mother died giving birth to him, and he prefers reading and writing to fighting. While on the one hand, this means Amir avoids violence and is gentle, it also means that he is prone to cowardice. He longs for the approval of his father, Baba, but his father clearly does not approve of Amir's softer personality. Baba is strict and instead praises the son of his servant who is the same age as Amir: Hassan. Hassan is Amir's best friend and, despite being picked on for being an ethnic Hazara (unlike Amir and Baba, who are Pashtun, the majority people group of Afghanistan) is quite defensive of Amir. Hassan loves the stories Amir creates, and he protects Amir from bullies like Assef, who is the main antagonist. However, Amir develops some underlying resentment towards Hassan on account of Baba's favoritism of him.

        Other important characters include Rahim Khan, Baba's best friend; Soraya, an Afghan woman whom Amir falls in love with and marries; and Sohrab, Hassan's son.

    <h1 id="chapter2" style="color: green;">chapter 2</h1>
    <p style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">Amir’s best friend and half-brother as well as a servant of Baba’s. Hassan proves himself a loyal friend to Amir repeatedly, defending Amir when he is attacked and always being ready to listen. His defining traits are bravery, selflessness, and intelligence, though his smarts are more instinctual than bookish, largely because he is uneducated. As a poor ethnic Hazara, he is considered an inferior in Afghan society, and he is the victim of racism throughout the novel as a result. He is Baba’s illegitimate child, though he is not aware of this fact, and he grows up with Ali acting as his father. His rape is an early catalyst in the story, and even though he is not present in a significant portion of the novel, he plays a major role throughout.</p>

    

    <h1 id="chapter3" style="color: green;">chapter 3</h1>
    <p style="background-color: brown; font-weight: bold;">Father of Amir and Hassan and a wealthy, well-respected businessman. Baba believes first and foremost in doing what is right and thinking for oneself, and he tries to impart these qualities to Amir. He also never lets anyone’s lack of belief in him stop him from accomplishing his goals. Although he distrusts religious fundamentalism, he follows his own moral code and acts with self-assurance and bravery. When necessary, he is even willing to risk his life for what he believes in. Yet his shame at having a child with a Hazara woman leads him to hide the fact that Hassan is his son. Because he cannot love Hassan openly, he is somewhat distant toward Amir and is often hard on him, though he undoubtedly loves him.
